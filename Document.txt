Verifications API
This project is developed for automated testing of the Verifications API. The endpoint used was https://private-538b1b-verificationsrv.apiary-mock.com/ 
Test Cases
Positive
- Create Verification
- Start Verification
- Upload Image
- Download report

Negative
- Create verification with invalid webhoon url
- Start verification with invalid id
- Upload invalid Image
- Download report with invalid id
All the negative test cases are failing because the Mock API always returns a positive response for incorrect requests as well.

Framework
1. I have automated the testing using REST Assured for the API's.
